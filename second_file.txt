Introduction

Jenkins is a wonderful system for managing builds, and people love using its UI to configure jobs. Unfortunately,
as the number of jobs grows, maintaining them becomes tedious, and the paradigm of using a UI falls apart. Additionally,
the common pattern in this situation is to copy jobs to create new ones, these "children" have a habit of diverging from
their original "template" and consequently it becomes difficult to maintain consistency between these jobs.

The Job DSL plugin attempts to solve this problem by allowing jobs to be defined in a programmatic form in a human readable
file. Writing such a file is feasible without being a Jenkins expert as the configuration from the web UI translates
intuitively into code.
